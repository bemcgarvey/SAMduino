# SAMduino

## A demonstartion board for the ATSAMV71N21B microcontroller.  Includes firmware projects to demonstrate many modules and features.  
  
### There is sample firmware for:
* Basic gpio and interrupts
* DMA
* High speed USB
* QSPI with a SST26VF064B flash
* CAN-FD
* ADC and DAC
* PWM
* True random number generator
* TWI
* RTC
* USB bootloader
* High speed USB mass storage device with QSPI flash
* etc


### All firmware is built in MPLabX with MPLab Harmony 3 and the XC32 compiler.  
### Schematic and PCB were made with KiCAD
